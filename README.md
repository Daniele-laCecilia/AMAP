# AMAP
Probabilistic indicator for threshold-based risk assessment

The AMAP indicator quantifies the impact of uncertain parameters on the probability of a target quantity to exceed user-defined thresholds. The indicator can be readily employed in probabilistic risk assessment.

We applied AMAP in la Cecilia et al., (2020) to quantify the sensitivity of soil and aquifer contamination following herbicide glyphosate (GLP), and its transformation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), dispersal to soil hydraulic parameters (k, b, psi_s, phi, Sr_l, Sr_g).
In the example provided here, the target quantity is GLP concentration in the aquifer.

# Curiosity:
"AMA" stands for Aronne Monica Alberto, who are the authors of the AMA family of indicators.
"AMAP" builds on the AMA family and adds the Probability framework.

# How to:
This function computes AMA sensitivity indices and principal Sobol Indices (Si) and AMAP starting from a set of Monte Carlo realizations. It also gives conditional moments with respect to one parameter at a time up to order 4.

To run the example:
If you use R, copy the .R scripts from the folder "R" and paste them in the folder "data"; then, run the main script "AMAP_analysis.R";
If you use Matlab, copy the .m scripts from the folder "Matlab" and paste them in the folder "data"; then, run the main script "AMAP_analysis.m".
In the main scripts (.R or .m), the Users can:
* Decide the indicators to plot by setting "var_out"
* Switch between an analysis of the parameters sensitivity to the target quantities at a fixed point in time or over time by setting the variable dotime=1 or dotime=0, respectively.

We invite the Users to test AMAP on their data, if suitable.
* Copy and paste the scripts in your working directory containing your data;
* In the INPUT section of the main scripts, the Users define:
  * The indicators to plot by setting "var_out";
  * The value of "dotime" to switch between an analysis at a fixed point in time or over time;
  * The .csv file name of the matrix "Sampling_points", containing Monte Carlo realizations of the parameters [n simulations x n parameters];
  * The .csv file names (fixed time and over time) of the matrix "Output_Mat", containing full model evaluations [n simulations x n time points]. Should you have only one file, either fixed time or over time, please fill both entries with the same file name and then set "dotime" accordingly;
  * The number of classes for "nclass" used to compute conditional statistics;
  * The threshold value for "thr".
* The script automatically get "name_var", the name of each output variable (text string);
* In Matlab, the color palette shall be edited if the number of uncertain parameters is different than 6;
* Run.

# Requirements
The scripts were tested in R 3.5.0 and Matlab 2019a.
